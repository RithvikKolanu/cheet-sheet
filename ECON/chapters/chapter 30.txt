E) Globalization has meant that Canadian labour markets are less exposed to economic fluctuations elsewhere in the world, which has decreased the NAIRU.

37) Which of the following statements best explains why unemployment rates in European countries have tended to be higher than unemployment rates in Canada or the United States? (Note: this statement refers not to the current recession in Europe but to a longer-term average.)
A) European countries have higher-paying jobs than Canada or the U.S., which causes an influx of workers into the labour force, which then increases the unemployment rate.
B) Workers in European countries have less skills and training than North American workers and therefore have higher rates of unemployment.
C) European countries have experienced more recessionary gaps than Canada or the U.S. and therefore have significantly higher cyclical unemployment.
D) Canada and the U.S. have greater labour-market flexibility than European countries.

12) Refer to Figure 30-2. Suppose the economy is in a short-run equilibrium at E1 after a negative supply shock. How will cyclical unemployment be reduced in the absence of any government policy intervention?
A) Cyclical unemployment will be reduced when the labour market becomes more flexible and can adjust to the changes in the supply of and demand for labour.
B) The excess supply of labour at E1 will eventually put downward pressure on wages, and AS will shift back to AS0 and full employment at E0.
C) Cyclical unemployment will only be reduced when AD grows such that AD shifts up to AD1 and full employment at E2.
D) A new NAIRU will be established at E1 and cyclical unemployment will drop to zero.
E) The excess supply of labour at E1 will eventually cause an increase in government purchases and AD will shift up to AD1 and full employment at E2.
