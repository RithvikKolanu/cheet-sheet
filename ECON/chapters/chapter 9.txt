The diagram below shows the short-run cost curves for 3 perfectly competitive firms in the same industry.



	FIGURE 9-6

26) Refer to Figure 9-6. Given that Firms A, B and C are in the same industry, is this industry in long-run equilibrium?
A) No, because Firm A is not producing at a profit-maximizing level of output.
B) No, because if the industry were in equilibrium, all 3 firms would be earning zero economic profits.
C) Yes, because all 3 firms are producing at their minimum average total cost.
D) Yes, because P = MC = MR for each of the 3 firms.
E) Yes, because each of the 3 firms is operating at its minimum efficient scale.

30) Suppose a perfectly competitive industry is in long-run equilibrium.  A new one-time cost-saving technology (which is freely available) is then developed and new plants are built.  Eventually, a new long-run equilibrium will be established where
A) new plants employ the new technology, but existing plants continue to produce as long as they cover their fixed costs.
B) high-cost and low-cost firms exist side by side and market output will be higher.
C) the industry supply curve has shifted to the left and price and output are both higher.
D) all plants continue to operate until they are physically worn out as long as price is greater than the firm's average variable cost.
E) all plants use the new technology, and market output will be higher and price will be lower.
