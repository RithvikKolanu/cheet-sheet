18) Consider a monopolistically competitive industry in long-run equilibrium. Will this industry be productively efficient? 
A) Yes. Since the firms are in long-run equilibrium, they will all be producing at the minimum of their LRAC curves. 
B) Yes. Since the firms are in long-run equilibrium, they will all be operating on their LRAC curves. 
C) Yes. In long-run equilibrium, each firm is producing at an output level where price is equal to marginal cost. 
D) No. Firms are selling their output at a level where price exceeds marginal cost and thus, by definition, cannot be productively efficient. 
E) No. Since firms are selling differentiated products and there is no industry-wide price, we cannot conclude that marginal cost will be equated across all firms.

B) No, because the marginal cost to producers of the butter produced is more than the marginal value to consumers.
C) Yes, because all points on the production possibilities boundary are allocatively efficient.

2) it became clear that oligopolistic industries can achieve both productive and allocative efficiency without government intervention;
