14) Refer to Figure 28-1. The Bank of Canada must be able to easily communicate its monetary policy actions to the public. Which approach is more amenable to this requirement, and why?
A) part (ii) - targeting the money supply: because an announcement of a 1% decrease in the money supply is more easily understood than an increase in the interest rate.
B) part (i) - targeting the interest rate: because the Bank of Canada can more easily instruct the commercial banks to raise their interest rates.
C) part (ii) - targeting the money supply: because the public can more easily understand that a decrease in reserves in the banking system makes it more difficult to get a loan or mortgage.
D) part (i) - targeting the interest rate: because changes in the interest rate are much more meaningful and understandable to the public than changes in the money supply.
