A) No, because firms in the monopolistically competitive market will not reach their minimum efficient scale as they would in perfect competition - the result is higher prices and lower output. 
B) No, because firms in the monopolistically competitive market do not produce at an output level where MC = MR, as in perfect competition, which leads to a different price and output in long-run equilibrium. 
C) No, firms in the monopolistically competitive market earn economic profits in the long run because they are facing a downward-sloping demand curve, whereas in perfect competition they earn zero profits.

23) The sugar industry in Canada is effectively a duopoly with two large firms competing with each other for market share. Suppose the two firms collude and successfully restrict joint output to that of a profit-maximizing monopolist. As a result, they each realize an increase in their profits. Why would this collusive agreement be difficult to sustain? 
A) Because each firm has an incentive to break the agreement by further restricting output in order to increase the price, thereby increasing their own profits. 
B) Because each firm has an incentive to break the agreement by increasing output in order to increase their own profits. 
C) Because the firm with the lower long-run average costs will be able to capture all sales, driving the second firm out of the market.
