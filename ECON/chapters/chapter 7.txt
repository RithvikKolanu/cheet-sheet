56) Refer to Table 7-6.  Suppose this firm is producing 210 pairs of shoes per time period and that the variable factor of production is labour.  Which of the following statements best describes this firm's production?
A) Additional units of labour employed will increase the average variable cost of producing shoes.
B) Marginal cost is higher than average variable cost, so average product must be rising.
C) Marginal cost is higher than average variable cost, so marginal product must be rising.
D) Each additional unit of labour employed reduces the average variable cost of the pairs of shoes.
