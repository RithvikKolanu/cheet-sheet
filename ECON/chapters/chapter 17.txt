24) Economic analysis of the optimal amount of pollution is typically done in terms of the amount of pollution abated, as opposed to the amount of pollution produced. Why?
A) Because it is more practical to measure the marginal costs of pollution abated than of pollution produced.
B) Because governments and environmental authorities can produce more reliable data on pollution abated than pollution produced, which facilitates the economic analysis.
C) Because the abatement of pollution is a "good" to which we can more easily apply the concepts of supply and demand.
D) Because there are no marginal benefits of pollution produced, so it is necessary to study pollution abated in order to equate marginal benefits and marginal costs.

3) Consider the following equation:
GHG =  ×  × GDP,
where 	GHG = world annual emissions of greenhouse gases
	Energy = world annual amount of energy consumed

A) the units of greenhouse gases emitted per unit of energy consumed.
B) greenhouse gas emissions expressed as a percentage of carbon-based energy consumed.
C) the total units of greenhouse gases emitted annually.
D) the units of energy consumed per unit of greenhouse gases emitted.
E) the energy efficiency of greenhouse gas emissions.

5) Consider the following equation:
GHG =  ×  × GDP,
where 	GHG = world annual emissions of greenhouse gases
	Energy = world annual amount of energy consumed
	GDP = world's annual gross domestic product

A) increased by 5%.
B) decreased by 5%.
C) was unchanged.
D) increased by 10%.
E) decreased by 10%.
