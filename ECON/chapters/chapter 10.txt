A) The firm is producing the same quantity, has successfully identified different segments of the market, and is able to capture some of the consumer surplus. 
B) The firm is restricting output to a level below that of the single-price monopolist, and thereby raises the price of its product and earns higher profits. 
C) The firm is producing a smaller quantity, is charging a different price for each unit sold and is earning higher profits. 
D) The firm is producing the same quantity, but charging a different price for each unit sold and is earning higher profits.

26) Consider a monopolist that is able to distinguish between two distinct market segments, A and B, for its product.  Marginal cost is constant at $18 for each unit produced.  The firm is currently selling its output at a single price and allocating its output across segments such that marginal revenue in segment A is $25 and marginal revenue in segment B is $15.  Is this firm maximizing its profit?
A) Yes, because it has set a price such that MC is between the MRs of the two market segments.
B) No, because it is only possible to equate MR and MC when there is a single MR curve.
